# SectionedRecyclerDemo
Demo of a sectioned recycler that utilizes MVP design and simple use of RxJava as an event bus

The recycler also supports fast-scrolling, material design scroll indicator for quick positioning, and links with the device's ContentProvider for contacts.

## Why build this?
I needed this type of functionality for an app I'm working on, and in the future I'd like to cross-reference this if needed. 

## Should I use this?
Sure, if you want. It's a very quickly prototyped app to demonstrate using a few third-party libraries to implement a sectioned recycler.

## What's missing? 
TODO: Add the quick section scrolling. The scroll indicator + fast scrolling should be able to navigate the sections better when using the scroll bar for navigation. I've been meaning to publish me finishing this part.. It's not very usable if fast scrolling just blows through each section.
